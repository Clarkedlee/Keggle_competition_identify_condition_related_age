# Keggle_competition_identify_condition_related_age
This is the kettle competition project to identify age-related health conditions.

## Goal of the Competition

This competition aims to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. You are being asked to predict if the person has one or more of the three medical conditions (Class 1) or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). You will create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics.

Determining if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect patient information. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions and then encoding these characteristics.

Your work will help researchers discover the relationship between measurements of certain characteristics and potential patient conditions.
